ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicolas   
My name is Nicolas Dos Santos, I am in my first year of engineering school, specialising in computer science. I discovered my passion for coding in high school thanks to the computer science and digital science option. 
Here, you will find my programming projects. They are all done in group because they are school projects. Group work doesn't bother me, on the contrary, I like the group spirit and it allows me to go further.
At the moment, I'm working on a business website project and then I'd like to take back my dating website to improve it because it was my first experience in web coding.
